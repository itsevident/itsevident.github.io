	<h1>Impact Reporting</h1>
	<p>As part of our commitment to contributing to the social and enviromental good, and in keeping with our goal of becoming a certified B Corporation, we are sharing metrics related to the impact of our business.</p>
	<h2>2017 Recap</h2>
	<p>Our goals and intentions for 2017 included:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1.1% for the environment: Contribute at least 1.1% of revenues to charitable environmental causes.<br><em>Status: COMPLETED and slightly exceeded. In 2017, Evident donated 1.19% of our gross revenues for the environment &ndash; to the <a href="http://lancasterconservancy.org/">Lancaster County Conservancy</a> and to <a href="https://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/">1% for the Planet</a>, of which Evident became a formal member in December 2017.</em> <br><img src="/1-percent-for-the-planet-logo.png" alt="1% for the Planet member" width="300" height="126"></li>
		<li>Carbon offset: In addition to that goal, pay to offset a minimum of 25% of our personal and business carbon footprint. <br><em>Status: EXCEEDED. In September 2017 we enrolled in the Carbonfund.org Carbon<em>free</em><sup>&reg;</sup> Partner program, offsetting more than 100% of Evident&rsquo;s carbon footprint for the year and subscribing in automatic annual renewal (<a href="/carbonfund-org-certificate.pdf" target="_blank">view PDF certificate</a>)</em>. <br><img src="/carbonfree-partner-2017-evident.png" alt="Carbonfund.org Carbonfree Partner" width="180" height="148"></li>
		<li>Local dollars: Return at least $2,500 to the local economy by using professional service providers who are located within Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. <br><em>Status: EXCEEDED. By the end of August 2017 we completed this goal, and by the end of 2017 Evident returned more than $20,000 (more than eight times our goal) to the local economy by using local independent service providers.</em></li>
		<li>Establish a minimum of 20% of Evident&rsquo;s expenses (excluding labor) spent with local independent suppliers. <br><em>Status: EXCEEDED. Excluding our charitable giving, fully 48% of Evident&rsquo;s expenses in 2017 were spent with independent businesses in Central Pennsylvania.</em></li>
		<li>Monitor, record, and report on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy usage, to improve upon in 2018. <br><em>Status: NOT COMPLETED. We did not monitor and track this impact in 2017.</em></li>
		<li>Reach a score of 80 in the <a href="http://bimpactassessment.net/">B Impact Assessment</a>. <br><em>Status: COMPLETED. At the end of 2017, our sunverified score was 83, with this breakdown by section:
			<ul>
				<li>Governance: 13.4</li>
				<li>Community: 53.4</li>
				<li>Environment: 13.3</li>
				<li>Customers: 2.9</li>
			</ul>
		</em></li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to these goals, in 2017 we also:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Implemented a written policy giving preference to suppliers owned by women or individuals from underrepresented populations, and followed it.</li>
		<li>Created a statement on the intended social and environmental impact of Evident&rsquo;s charitable contributions.</li>
		<li>Changed our organization&rsquo;s business structure from a Pennsylvania sole proprietorship to a Pennsylvania benefit LLC.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>2018 Goals and Progress</h2>
	<p>Our goals and intentions for 2018 include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Switch from current bank (Bank of America) to a local cooperative bank or credit union committed to serving the community. <br><em>Status: COMPLETED. In January, we opened business accounts at Members 1st credit union and switched our banking there.</em></li>
		<li>Achieve formal recognition as a certified B Corporation. <br><em>Status: In progress. We submitted our application on February 7, 2018, with help and encouragement from Sarah Payne and Craig Dalen at <a href="https://assetspa.org/">ASSETS</a>. We have completed a review call with a B Lab analyst, provided requested verification documentation, and are awaiting review.</em></li>
		<li>Find ways to use travel expenses in a way better in line with our goals of spending with local, independent suppliers, particularly those owned by women or members of other underrepresented populations.</li>
		<li>Make a formal commitment to donate at least 5% of total company time to serving nonprofits. Create a structured process for selecting which organizations to support for the greatest positive impact. <br><em>Status: In progress. We are hereby making an ongoing commitment to donate no less than 5% of total company time to serving nonprofit organizations. Details on how we select organizations will be forthcoming.</em></li>
		<li>Continue to uphold our commitments of:
			<ul>
				<li>Donating at least 1% of our gross revenues for the benefit of the environment</li>
				<li>Maintaining or improving an 80+ score in the B Impact Assessment</li>
				<li>Upholding our legal obligations as a Pennsylvania benefit LLC</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>We will continue to update this page with our progress toward these goals throughout the year and at the end of the year.</p>
